<p>... working on a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.shaolinmicro.com&#47;">Aptus server<&#47;a> which I have to have ready tomorrow for at customer. It serves so called 'fit clients', and I like the concept... though I wouldn't (probably never) trade my favorite distro.... Debian :-D<br />
Aptus only works with distos like SUSE and Redhat.</p>
<p>Well.... hurray!<br />
It works - *everybody cheering* - I must be tired.<br />
I'll better finish this up so I can get home and get some sleep.</p>
