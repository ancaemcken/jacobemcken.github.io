<p>Still can't get Postfix to save my mail in Maildir format :-(<br />
It seems that Postfix don't have permission to save the emails where I directed it to, even though it should. And of top of it all Courier-IMAP won't authendicate via MySQL.</p>
<p>But this sucker ain't going to get me down... I will fight to the end. Eventualy I will get reinforcements :)</p>
<p>Thor, Per, Steffen... HELP!</p>
