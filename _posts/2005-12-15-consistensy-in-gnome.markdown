<p>I use GNOME both at work and at home and I love it. Though one thing have annoyed me a lot lately and that is that shifting through tabs in gnome-terminal and gedit uses different keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>So now I filed a [usability bug][1] on that very issue.</p>
<p>I hope it gets fixed for GNOME 2.14 (Dapper Drake). Having gedit with VFS support (like editing files directly over ssh), gnome-terminal with better performance (through all the work put into Pango - the font rendering library), it will be a killer release... at least for me. </p>
