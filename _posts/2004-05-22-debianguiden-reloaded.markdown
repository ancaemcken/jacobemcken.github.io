<p>Yesterday I worked with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mbrix.dk&#47;">Morten Brix Petersen<&#47;a> to implement user comments on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.debianguiden.dk&#47;">Danish Debian guide<&#47;a>. User comment functionality like the one found on PHP's documentation. While we where at make enhancements we also redesigned the frontpage to look like the rest of the guide.</p>
<p>First the front page was designed using tableless design but IE and Konqueror (incl. Safari) couldn't handle it. Now the page useses two tables :( not something I'm proud of but hey now it works.</p>
<p>Next target is the layout of the search functionality (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.htdig.org&#47;">ht:&#47;&#47;Dig<&#47;a>), which should be integratede with the rest of the guide.</p>
