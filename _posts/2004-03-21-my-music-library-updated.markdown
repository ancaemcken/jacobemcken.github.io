excerpt: "Today I found some time to try out <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.rhythmbox.org&#47;\">Rhythmbox<&#47;a>
  the music player inspired by iTunes. I had head that it was good... and so far I'm
  not dissapointed.\r\n\r\nThis cool player made me want some new music so I surfed
  the net for some new stuff. My music taste is pretty broard so I ended up with this:\r\nMew
  - Frengers (cdon)\r\nCreed - Weathered (cdon)\r\nOasis - Heathen Chemistry (cdon)\r\nBlack
  Eyed Peas - Elephunk (cd-wow)\r\nBritney Spears - In The Zone (cd-wow)\r\n\r\nIt
  is really crappy that <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.cd-wow.com&#47;\">CD-WOW<&#47;a>
  had to raise their prices... yes I know why but it's still sad. Now that I found
  a job so I can actually buy my music they go and pull a stunt like this. :(\r\n\r\nCD-WOW
  has far from all music so I have to supplement with <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.cdon.com&#47;\">CDON<&#47;a>
  ( a nordic online music reseller).\r\nI have to look for some price indexes and
  alternative sites to buy music so that I can get it as cheap as possible :)\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing I don't like is the fact that I haven't found a decent download music shop
  to use. TDC has started a music shop but it only works in IE and with Windows Media
  Player AFAIK :( <b>Crap site!<&#47;b>\r\nI want to buy my music! Why do they have
  to make it so hard?\r\n\r\n\n"
