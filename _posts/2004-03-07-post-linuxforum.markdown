<p>Wheeew... it was two great days.<br />
I meet Morten from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.debianguiden.dk&#47;">debianguiden.dk<&#47;a> which I had been looking forward.</p>
<p>Peter Toft introduced me to Jacob Nordfalk who have written a few <a href="http:&#47;&#47;javabog.dk&#47;">Java books<&#47;a>. He was interested in helping out with FriFinans and he clarified a few things for me and commented on the code.</p>
<p>Overall today was just a relaxing day with my girlfriend whom I have neglected the last couple of days.</p>
