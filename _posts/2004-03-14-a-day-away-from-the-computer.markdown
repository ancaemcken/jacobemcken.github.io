<p>Today I went to se the new grand shopping center <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fields.dk&#47;">Fields<&#47;a> just opened in Denmark.<br />
I got some new T-Shirts and I bought <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gamespot.com&#47;ps2&#47;action&#47;jak2&#47;index.html">Jak II - Renegade<&#47;a> for 199DKK ~ 27&euro; (today on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.xe.com&#47;">xe.com<&#47;a>)</p>
<p>I played it for about an hour and I'm impressed! Allready from start it is alot more variated than the first game. I seems alot more like <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank<&#47;i> which I think is good.</p>
