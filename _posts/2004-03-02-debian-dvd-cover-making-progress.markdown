<p>Well I better go to bed now... just had to see <i>24 Hours<&#47;i> with Jack Bauer :)<br />
But before I give my computer a rest I'll post my latest work on my Debian DVD cover.<br />
<a href="&#47;graphics&#47;Debian Sarge DVD cover 0.2.png">PNG format<&#47;a> for preview.<br />
<a href="&#47;graphics&#47;Debian Sarge DVD cover 0.2.svg">SVG format<&#47;a></p>
<p>I'm beginning to learn how this SVG shit works... sadly the tools for Linux are limited (as far as I know). Half the time I have to use a text editor to edit the SVG image. Both because some things aren't supported and because the the output from the tools are far from optimized.</p>
