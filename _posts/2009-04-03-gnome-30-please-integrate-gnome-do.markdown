<p>After reading the the Gnome 3.0 announcements ([Vincent Untz][1], [Andre Klapper][2]) yesterday and reading [The Plan][3], I don't really know if I got exited or dissapointed :)</p>
<p>Anyway Gnome works very well for me already (version 2.26) so I guess the limited amount of visible changes is a plus for me after all. But one thing I would like to see integrate and officially backed by the Gnome Team is [Gnome-Do][4]. My desktop experience took a great leap forward after getting used to this way of interacting with my computer. I while back I read a very exiting blog post about [incorporating Gnome-Do to the very core of Gnome][5].</p>
<p>Now THAT would ROCK HARD for something to include in Gnome 3.0 :D</p>
