<p>After yesterdays small data loss I have been working hard tonight to prepare the site for the update that I have been working on for so long now. All the pieces seem to have fallen together now and the new site seems to be running just fine.</p>
<p>The transission to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;smarty.php.net&#47;">Smarty<&#47;a> and an enchanced data structure was hard work by I hope that it eventually will pay off. I have made a small update to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.debianart.dk&#47;submissions&#47;any&#47;oldest&#47;">the 3 old wallpapers<&#47;a>. I have removed my email from them which was tagged on the lower left corner.</p>
<p>Next step(s) for the Debianart website:<br />
* Different sorting of submissions (oldest, top downloads etc.)<br />
* Graphics and news submissions directly from users<br />
* Give me your ideas!!!</p>
<p>Now I'm tired :)</p>
