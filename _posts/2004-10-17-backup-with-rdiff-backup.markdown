<p>Why do I have to learn the hard way?!?</p>
<p>When you want to write <b>rm *~<&#47;b> dont stop half way there (<b>rm *<&#47;b>).<br />
Luckily It was only a few templates for the developer version of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.debianart.dk&#47;">Debianart<&#47;a> that got wiped, but it has delayed kick off yet again. Perhapes next weekend?</p>
<p>But the event made me look at a way to backup my important files. A colleague recommended <b>rdiff-backup<&#47;b> for backup and I have look at it and found it worthy :)<br />
I have used <a href="http:&#47;&#47;rdiff-backup.stanford.edu&#47;examples.html">some examples<&#47;a> I found on the net to get a picture on how it works. The good news is that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;packages.debian.org&#47;cgi-bin&#47;search_packages.pl?searchon=names&amp;subword=1&amp;version=all&amp;release=all&amp;keywords=rdiff-backup&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search">rdiff-backup exists as a Debian package<&#47;a>.</p>
