<p>The last 4 months my battery life on my laptop has becomming really bad. Mid december it died after a year and four months of good service.<br />
Last week I ordered and recieved a new one - yay!</p>
<p>Right now I'm sitting in the train on my way home from work. Just finished watching the movie "[You got served][1]" on my laptop - a street dance movie. I can only say one thing... they surely know how to move :-)</p>
