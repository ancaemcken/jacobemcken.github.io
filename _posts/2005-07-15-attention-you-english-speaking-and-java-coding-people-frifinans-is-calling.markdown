<p>Yesterday I [translated the danish "getting started coding" guide into english][1]. One less excuse for not contributing to [FriFinans][2]. It is all pretty straight forward but if you should get stuck you are more than welcome to contact me.</p>
<p>For those how don know what FriFinans is...<br />
It's an open source multiuser accounting system soon to take over the world ;-)<br />
We have put alot of thoughts in the design fase until now and I'm really proud of the outcome... Frank has been great. I really think FriFinans has a solid and thought through base for the application.</p>
<p>Right now Frank is working on the foundation af advanced history logging, and through that the ability to roll back changes made to objects (ie. a debtor).</p>
