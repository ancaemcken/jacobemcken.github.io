<p>Yesterday evening I attended a lecture named "<i><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.osl.dk&#47;nyhed&#47;alle_nyheder&#47;debataften_010404&#47;">Open Source - Linux, disruptive technology or cost cutting measure?<&#47;i><&#47;a>" where <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.suse.com&#47;us&#47;company&#47;press&#47;services&#47;information&#47;company&#47;particulars.html">Richard Seibt<&#47;a> spoke. There where about 20 people and it was very exciting.<br />
I talked a little bit with him later and he seems like a really great guy.</p>
