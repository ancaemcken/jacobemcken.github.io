<p>Some time ago a [friend of mine][2] introduced me to [Pure Pwnage][1], and yesterday I took the time to watch all episodes.</p>
<p>It is a video show about a "pro" gamer who totally own noobs... and stuff, LOL. First I was like, okay I'll watch, but I know he dosn't own as much as me - rite, then I'm okay he is cool and all - you know.</p>
<p>Okay enought of the wierd Pure Pwnage thounge :-D<br />
If you are just a tiny bit into computer games, I'm sure you will find this worth while watching - ENJOY.</p>
