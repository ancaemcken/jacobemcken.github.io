<p>Since last time I blogged I have filed another consistensy bug for GNOME... but it seems people confuse consistensy with a specific behavior.<br />
The [Nautilus sorting bug][1] is about having Nautilus, File Roller, Open&#47;Save File Dialog and others to sort list of files the same way - not a specific way...  just the same way.<br />
The [Gedit and gnome-terminal bug][2] is about using the same keyboard shortcut keys for shifting between tabs - not a specific key combination.</p>
<p>Both bugs are made dupes of other bugs IMHO isn't the same bug... it might be related but still it is NOT the same bug.</p>
<p>It seems to me that people are more interested in getting rid of bug reports that understand what the bug is acutally about. In my eyes it looks like people are trying to push responsibillity away. I don't care if it is GTK's "problem" or what ever. If you think it is GTK problem the file the bug with GTK... or encurage me to do it - I wouldn't mind. My problem is that I'm not into how all this bug repoting works (when crossing the boundaries of a single project). I feel insecure and afraid of doing it all wrong. Comon lets get a dialog started - help me help you.</p>
<p>This post was an other way to say that I'm disappointed :-(</p>
