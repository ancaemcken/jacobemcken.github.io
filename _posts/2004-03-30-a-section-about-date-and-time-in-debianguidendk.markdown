<p>On my way to work I got a crazy thought. IIRC at least 3 questions about how to set time and date has been asked on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.debianforum.dk&#47;">the danish Debian help forum<&#47;a>. This should be addressed with writing a section about how to set date and time on a Debian box. The section should contain a little info about <i>date<&#47;i>, <i>rdate<&#47;i> with cron and a third command to set the date (which I can't remember the name).</p>
<p><i>NOTE TO MYSELF: GET IT DONE!<&#47;i></p>
