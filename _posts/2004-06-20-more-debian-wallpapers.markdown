After making my first wallpaper I got a lot of idears I wanted to realize... and now I have (with some of them).<br />
I have added two new wallpapers to my <a href="&#47;files&#47;">files section<&#47;a> called '<i>First love<&#47;i>' (the red) and '<i>Natures gift<&#47;i>' (the green). You can see a thumb of them right here in this post.</p>
<p>My first wallpaper I also uploaded to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gnome-look.org&#47;">GNOME-look.org<&#47;a> and I have allready had almost 200 downloads. This is cool :)</p>
