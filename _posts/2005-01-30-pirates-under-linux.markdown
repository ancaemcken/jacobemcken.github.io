<p>While I installed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winehq.org&#47;">WINE<&#47;a> on Ubuntu I went to WINE's website and read some of their weekly newsletters. I must be a sick person because I find a lot of their articles interesting :-)</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.winehq.org&#47;?issue=258#Pirates!%20Screenshot">a specific one<&#47;a> which caught my immediate attention. I guy have been working on DirectX 9, and have troubled him self with making the new Sid Meier's Pirates playable :-D</p>
<p>Some might say that I could use Cedega... but I cant really decide wether I like their initiative???<br />
I would like to see some of Cedega's work be put back into WINE just like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeweavers.com&#47;">CodeWeavers<&#47;a> does with CrossOver Office.</p>
<p>Now I'm waiting for a newer WINE in Ubuntu Hoary... looking forward to the day reboots to Windows just to play a game is just something you look back at and laught.</p>
