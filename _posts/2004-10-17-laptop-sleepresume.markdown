<p>I have trouble making my laptop resume after I finally got it to sleep. I have reported <a href="http:&#47;&#47;bugme.osdl.org&#47;show_bug.cgi?id=3390">a bug<&#47;a> on the problem. It seems that it is making progress... though I will test some more to se if I have made mistakes :(<br />
It seems I'm good at that.</p>
