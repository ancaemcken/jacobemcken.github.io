<p>Today I found this article: '<i><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.osnews.com&#47;story.php?news_id=6460">SVG and its Path into the Linux Desktop<&#47;a><&#47;i>' on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.osnews.com&#47;">osnews.com <&#47;a>. I is pretty exiting reading if you think SVG is cool.</p>
<p><a href="&#47;weblog&#47;uploads&#47;OOo_dvd_cover.png"><img style='border: 0px;padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;float: left;vertical-align: top' src='&#47;weblog&#47;uploads&#47;OOo_dvd_cover.thumb.png' alt='' &#47;><&#47;a> At work I continued improving the layout on a DVD size cover for a danish production of OpenOffice.org which I have been working on for some time now.</p>
<p>I added the pen and paper on the front today. The art is taken from a really cool icon theme called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;zeus.qballcow.nl&#47;icons.php">Gartoon<&#47;a> made by Zeus (realname Kuswanto). Take a look at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;zeus.qballcow.nl&#47;">Zeus' homepage<&#47;a> for a lot of great stuff. I will write him an email later to ask if it is okay to use this :)<br />
I sure hope so because I really looks good.</p>
<p>I still have a few idears to improve the cover:<br />
1. Put shadow on the screenshots on the back of the cover.<br />
2. Make a small white glow around the text beneath the pen and paper icon to make it easier to read.</p>
<p><i>UPDATE - I have now added a shadow to the screenshots (see picture above)<&#47;i></p>
