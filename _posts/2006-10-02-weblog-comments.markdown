<p>I just went through a lot of comments which was pending approval. The reason why I haven't done this before is because I hadn't noticed that I had pending messages. Though the last few months have been a bit on the slow side. If I had been blogging regular I might have noticed before. Most comments was to my old post about [MP3 ripping in sound Juicer][1]. A lot of good tips in between, I'm really sorry guys.</p>
<p>I had like 4000 spam messages which I had to dig through first :(</p>
<p>I'm planning on updating my weblog software soon, perhaps it becomes easier to manage.</p>
