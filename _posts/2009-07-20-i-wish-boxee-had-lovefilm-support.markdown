<p>After using [Boxee][1] for some time now I tried to find an European alternative and landed on [Lovefilm][2]. Sadly Lovefilm isn't accessible through Boxee.</p>
<p>Lovefilm at least supports Firefox users... if I would ever find the time to try write a plugin myself this is the links I would use:</p>
<p>First of I'm not alone thinking [Lovefilm for Boxee would a great idea][3] :D</p>
<p>Next I would need some [information about developing plugins for Boxee (incl. a tutorial)][4].</p>
<p>Lastly I would probably need [some][5] [stuff][6] for Emacs which I've been using for a while now.</p>
