<p>I have been looking for a portable DVD&#47;CD drive to add the only function my laptop dosn't have. Thought it was on purpose I bought it without a DVD&#47;CD drive. I rarely have use for such a drive and I wanted my laptop to be as small as possible (Debian is installable with an USB key). At home I could use a CD-burner but again this is only a function a rarely use and until now have managed to deal with in alternative ways.</p>
<p>But now I'm thinking of installing Ubuntu on my laptop and for that I need a CD-drive. I could borrow one at work, but I think the time has come to buy one myself.</p>
<p>I have found this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.aopen.nl&#47;Products&#47;dvd+rw&#47;esv-289u.htm">slick AOpen drive<&#47;a> which I think would look good besides my IBM X40 :-D</p>
<p>I have also found some addinional pictures of the drive in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.3dgameman.com&#47;forums&#47;showthread.php?t=25923">3D Game Man forum<&#47;a>.</p>
